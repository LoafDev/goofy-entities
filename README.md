### Goofy Entities
A small mod made purely for the purpose of adding
_goofy_ stuff to the game.

Currently, this mod only adds a few things:
* Chilli pepper
  * Will grant the player five seconds of speed boost upon eating
  * Can be used to grow chilli pepper crop, which will drop one to three chilli peppers when fully grown
* Golden chilli pepper
  * Will grant the player 15 seconds of speed boost and __guarantee critical effect__ upon eating
* Guarantee critical effect
  * Every damage dealt to entities will be multiplied by 1.5 at base, just like a critical attack
  * Doing a critical attack while having this effect will do a _black flash_, which allows the player to deal up to 2.25 times base damage 

Roadmap without a map (strikethrough means completed):
* ~~Give black flash a custom sound effect~~
* make achievements for:
    * First black flash
    * Four consecutive black flashes
    * Finish an entity with a black flash
* ~~Make chill pepper a crop~~ and drop from hostile mobs

Dependencies:
* [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
* [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
* Minecraft 1.21.9 (any other version isn't supported!)
* Fabric loader **0.18.1** and above!
